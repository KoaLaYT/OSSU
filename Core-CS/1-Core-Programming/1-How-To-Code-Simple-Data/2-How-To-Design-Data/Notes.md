### Goals

- Be able to use the How to Design Data Definitions (HtDD) recipe to design data definitions for atomic data.
- Be able to identify problem domain information that should be represented as simple atomic data, intervals, enumerations, itemizations and mixed data itemizations.
- Be able to use the Data Driven Templates recipe to generate templates for functions operating on atomic data.
- Be able to use the How to Design Functions (HtDF) recipe to design functions operating on atomic data.

### A data definition consists of four or five elements:

1. A possible **structure definition** (not until compound data)
2. A **type comment** that defines a new type name and describes how to form data of that type.
3. An **interpretation** that describes the correspondence between information and data.
4. One or more **examples** of the data.
5. A **template** for a 1 argument function operating on data of this type.
