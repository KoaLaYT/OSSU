            A little summary of the course --
            <strong>How To Code: Simple Data</strong>

                    This is the final project of How To Code: Simple Data, but
                    written in HTML and JS!
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this course, I learnt how to split a complex problem such
                    as this game into several parts, so that at a time, I only
                    have to focus one simple things, but still get the whole
                    programm architecture in mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This all happened because of three excellent recipes:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>How to Design Data</strong>: is the fundation, the data structure will strongly affect the function design and overall world design.</li>
                        <li><strong>How to Design Function</strong>: the template is very useful especially in self referenced data structure. I think I understand recursive much better after this courses.</li>
                        <li><strong>How to Design World</strong>: this make me write more clean and structured code, which is way more readable and maintanable.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    As I am going to be a formal frontend programmer in this September, I decided to practice these skills in my day to day used language: JS!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here is how I wrote this game:
                    <ol>
                        <li>write the big-bang framework in JS:
                            <p>I only implement the on-tick, to-draw, stop-when and on-key functionalities for the simplicity. With the help of <code>window.requestAnimationFrame</code>, the work is fairly easy.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>then, just follow the recipe of HtDW:
                            <ol>
                                <li>domain analysis:
                                    The is game is fairly simple, and all the analysis is already made by the course teacher.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    define constants
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    define data definitions
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    write the structure of whole program, and inplement every helper functions.
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>And this is what I got:</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <canvas width="300" height="500"></canvas>
                <button class="trigger">Start</button>
            </section>
        </main>

        <script src="./big-bang.js"></script>
        <!--
            <script src="./test/simple-countdown.js"></script>
        -->
        <script src="./space-invader.js"></script>
        <script type="text/javascript">
            const btn = document.querySelector('.trigger');
            btn.addEventListener('click', e => {
                btn.blur();
                canvas.click(); // make keyboard interactive with canvas
                main(new Game([], [], new Tank(150, 1)));
            });
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
