### Goals

- How to express a UML class diagram as a Java program, including expressing associations and aggregations
- How to initialize and set fields that depend on each other
- How to ensure a Java class can be used correctly with the Java Collections Framework by correctly overriding appropriate methods (e.g., equals, hashCode)
