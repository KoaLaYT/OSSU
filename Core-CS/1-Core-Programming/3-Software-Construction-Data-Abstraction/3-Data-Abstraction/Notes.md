### Goals

- How to describe how data abstraction makes possible the construction of larger software systems
- How to specify a data abstraction for a Java class such that you can then move forward to creating tests for it
- How to consider use cases for a data abstraction to ensure that it is complete and meets your needs
- How to specify tests for a data abstraction such that you can be reasonably confident that your data abstraction's implementation meets its specification
- How to implement a data abstraction by deciding on an internal data representation and implementing the bodies of the specified methods.
