### Goals

-   What options there are for types in Java (Classes, Abstract Classes, and Interfaces), and which type can be used to create objects (just Classes!)
-   Type hierarchies: get to know how subtypes can be used in place of super types for declaration, instantiation and parameter passing
-   Method dispatch: how Java determines which implementation of a method to use when that method is called
-   How to extract a type from a class to better structure a codebase and make it more extensible
