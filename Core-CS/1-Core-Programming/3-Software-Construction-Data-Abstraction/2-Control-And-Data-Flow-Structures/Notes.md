### Goals

- **Java concepts**: classes, methods, how data flows in programs, how parameters are passed, how values are returned from methods, and how objects are created.
- **Control-flow models**: how to depict and communicate the internal execution of a method using flowcharts and how to depict and communicate the execution of a program using call graphs.  We will show you how to use a debugger to help produce these control-flow models from given Java source code
