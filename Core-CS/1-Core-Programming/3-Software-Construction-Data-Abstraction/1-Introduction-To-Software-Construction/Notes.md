### Goals

-   How to explore the behaviour and structure of a system
-   How to draw a diagram of the relationships between packages and between classes to help your understanding of a totally new system
-   Make small changes to a system that you know nothing about, to see if it breaks or changes (this is the beginning of code exploration)
