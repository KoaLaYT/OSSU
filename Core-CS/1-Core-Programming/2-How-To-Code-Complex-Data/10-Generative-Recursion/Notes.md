### Goals

-   Be able to identify whether a recursive function (or a set of mutually recursive functions) uses structural or generative recursion.
-   Be able to formulate a termination argument for a recursive function (or a set of mutually recursive functions).
-   Be able to design functions that use generative recursion (algorithms).
