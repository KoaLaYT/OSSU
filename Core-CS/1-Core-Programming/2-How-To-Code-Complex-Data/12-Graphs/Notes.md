### Goals

-   Be able to identify when domain information naturally forms a graph.
-   Be able to write data definitions for graphs.
-   Be able to construct cyclic data.
-   Be able to design templates that operate on graphs, using accumulators to prevent chasing infinite cycles in the graph.
-   Be able to design functions that operate on graphs.
