### Goals

- Be able to identify problem domain information of arbitrary size that should be represented using arbitrary arity trees.
- Be able to use the design recipes to design with arbitrary arity trees.
- Be able to use the design recipes with mutually-referential data.
- Be able to predict and identify the correspondence between external-, self- and mutual-reference in a data definition and calls, recursion and mutual-recursion in functions that operate on the data.
